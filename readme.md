Right now(2020), New York is one of the worst hit state by COVID-19 in USA. New York city is at the center of the disaster. The hospitals are already stretched thin with patients overflowing. According to New York Times report, (at the moment of writing) death toll was 365, case count topped 23,000.

I was motivated by this to create something useful which would give some insight on this situation. In this project we are going to determine which neighborhood is best prepared for this pandemic, by finding out the best ratio of hospital beds per person for each neighborhood in this city.

*By all means, the reports here should not be used as a measuring tool, because in reality the situation has been changed a lot since Coronavirus COVID-19 has hit the city.*
